# errors

the hierarchy should be:

main error:
  - io error
  - interpreter error
     - Vec<scan error>
     - Vec<parse error>
        - unexpected token
        - unexpected eof
     - runtime error
        - arity mismatch
        - value error / type error
        - zero division
        - undefined variable
        - break exception
        - return exception
        - "system time error"
        - non callable called
